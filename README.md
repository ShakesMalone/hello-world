# hello-world
I have no idea what I am doing here but it can't wait to learn.

I was in the Marine Corps for a little under five years, and through the nonstop pace and unearthly challenges, I was taught to adapt to any work position and still perform optimally. My formal eduction at TCU taught me how to most efficiently research and analyze evidence and information on vitually every thing and every person and connect those data points to the greater picture. I learned how to effectively disseminate that information or idea to a much larger audience from both experiences. I really want to be used a problem-solver, the one-stop shop for an organization that could benefit from a very calculated researcher and social ninja. I try to be methodical and confident as a public speaker and organizational liaison to promote the best image, however in interperson interactions I have always tried to put the person first. I really hope people don't look at a political science degree and pidgeon-hole me to that realm. As an intel specialist, we set ourselves apart as being a jack-of-all-trades. That versatility has greatly benefitted my professional development, and I feel like I understand enough about social communication and how organizationas interact with individual workers and clients, as well as with the public, to serve a wide number of functions. I have always felt drawn to be interacting with people in a career form, but retail isn't my style and in some ways I think I function best as the lifeline between an organization and the people they serve.

Still not too sure on GitHub but I'll keep toying with it and eventually break something so look out for that.
