# hello-world
I have no idea what I am doing here but it can't wait to learn.

I was in the Marine Corps, and it taught me how to adapt to any work position, and then my educaiton at TCU taught me how to most efficiently research and analyze evidence and information, as well as how to effectively disseminate that information or idea to a much larger audience. I really want to be a problem-solver fora company or organization that could benefit from a very intelligent, calculated analyst and social scienctist, as well as a methodical and confident public speaker and liaison. I really hope people look at a political science degree and pidgeon-hole me to that realm, becuase they would be missing out on my versatility.
